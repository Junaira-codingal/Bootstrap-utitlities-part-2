      <p>
        On November 24, 1971, a man calling himself
        <strong>Dan Cooper</strong> boarded Flight 305 from Portland to Seattle.
        Mid-flight, he handed a note to a flight attendant, claiming he had a
        bomb. He demanded $200,000, four parachutes, and a fuel stop in Reno,
        Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FBI met Cooper’s demands, and in Seattle, the passengers were freed.
        He then ordered the plane back into the air with only the pilots and a
        flight attendant. Somewhere over Washington state, at 10,000 feet, he
        jumped into the stormy night—and was never seen again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authorities launched one of the longest-running FBI investigations in
        history. Despite extensive searches, no parachute, body, or confirmed
        trace of Cooper was ever found. Only $5,800 of the ransom money surfaced
        in 1980, buried near the Columbia River, deepening the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        For decades, theories have ranged from Cooper dying in the jump to him
        living a new life under a different identity. The FBI officially closed
        the case in 2016, but Cooper remains a legend—an unknown mastermind who
        pulled off the perfect heist and disappeared forever.
