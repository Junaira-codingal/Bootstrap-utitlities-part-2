        <strong>Jack the Ripper</strong> is the nickname given to an
        unidentified serial killer active in the late 19th century, specifically
        in the Whitechapel district of London. The killer's identity remains a
        mystery, and the case continues to intrigue both professional
        investigators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name "Jack the Ripper" was first used in a letter sent to the police
        in 1888, although there is no proof that the letter was written by the
        killer. The crimes involved gruesome murders, and the killer is believed
        to have been a male with knowledge of human anatomy, as the victims were
        mutilated in disturbing ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The victims of Jack the Ripper were primarily women, and the police were
        never able to catch the culprit, despite various investigations and
        theories about his identity. The killings stopped abruptly, further
        deepening the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, many theories and suspects have emerged, but none have
        been definitively proven to be the killer. The case remains one of the
        most famous unsolved mysteries in history.
