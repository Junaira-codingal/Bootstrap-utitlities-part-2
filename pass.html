        In 1959, nine skilled hikers from the Ural Polytechnic Institute set out
        on an expedition to Mount Otorten in Russia. They were experienced and
        well-prepared, but when they failed to return, a search party was sent.
        What rescuers found would become one of the most baffling unsolved
        mysteries in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        When their tent was found, it had been slashed open from the inside, as
        if the hikers had fled in terror. Their bodies were discovered scattered
        in the snowâ€”some half-dressed, others with horrific injuries, including
        crushed skulls and missing eyes and tongues. Strangely, there were no
        signs of struggle or footprints leading to their deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanations for their deaths range from avalanche or hypothermia to
        secret Soviet military tests and UFOs. Some reports suggest high
        radiation levels on their clothing, further fueling conspiracy theories.
        But no theory fully explains the bizarre conditions in which they died.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 60 years later, the Dyatlov Pass Incident remains one of the
        most chilling and unexplained cases in history. Despite new
        investigations and official reports, no one knows what truly happened
        that night. The truth is still buried beneath the ice of the Ural
        Mountains.
